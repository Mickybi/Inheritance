For this exercise, we want you to code a generic superclass and at least three subclasses of that superclass, each class needs to have at least 2 attributes and 2 methods. Itâ€™s easiest to simply describe a real-world object in this manner.  You need to provide a test method that shows your classes in operation.

 

I would highly suggest that you look at week 8 and the final project.   You should pick a system for your week 8 project now and start building using this assignment as a base.

Final Project info:

Create a number of elements toward the building of one of the following systems:   Note - you won't be building the entire system - just pieces
Leave Management System
Hotel Management System
Time Keeping System
Pizza Ordering System (like Domino's online for example)
Point of Sale System
Backend for a Blog System
The elements you are responsible for include:
A minimum of 12 use cases - fully elaborated!
A rough sketch of the UI of the system to give yourself some grounding 
Architecture Diagram showing major systems
Class Diagram for major classes in your system - 12-15 classes
Create a sequence diagram for 1-3 objects that realize one of your use cases
Python application using the 6+ major classes demonstrating the core functionality - GUIs are NOT required.
